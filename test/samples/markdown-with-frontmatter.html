<p>Vladimir Starkov <a href="http://vstarkov.com/monthbook/">suggests</a> to read at least two technical books a month.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s very important to be up-to-date with latest trends, especially in so fast changing industry as front-end development. But there are so many interesting subjects besides  programming languages and new frameworks.</p>
