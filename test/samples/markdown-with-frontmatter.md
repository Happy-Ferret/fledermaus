Vladimir Starkov [suggests](http://vstarkov.com/monthbook/) to read at least two technical books a month.

Itâ€™s very important to be up-to-date with latest trends, especially in so fast changing industry as front-end development. But there are so many interesting subjects besides  programming languages and new frameworks.
